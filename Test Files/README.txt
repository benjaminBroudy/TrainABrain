These documents are for making an XOR gate.

An XOR gate will only return a true, or one, when one and only one of the two binary digits going in is a 1

If you enter a 1 and 1, it will return a zero, and if you enter a 0 and 0, it will return a zero

If you enter a 0 an 1, it will return a one, and if you enter a 1 and 0, it will return a one

You can train your own with the input and output data files, or you can run one already made using the file named "XOR Gate Neural Network"

The pre-made Neural Net in this folder was trained with 4 hidden neurons, 100,000,000 reps, and a learn rate of 0.2
